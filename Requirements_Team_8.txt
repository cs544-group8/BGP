BGP Protocol Requirements

Client/Server Requirements:
    Stateful: Both client and server must implement, check and validate the statefulness of the BGP protocol DFA.
        Client: <file(s) or location(s) in code>
        Server: <file(s) or location(s) in code>

Server-specific Requirements:

    Concurrent: Server must be able to handle multiple clients.
        Server: <file(s) or location(s) in code>

    Service: The server must bind to a hardcoded port number and the client defaults to that port number.
        Server: <file(s) or location(s) in code>

Client-specific Requirements:

    IP and hostname: Client must be able to specify the hostname and/or the IP address of the server.
        Client: <file(s) or location(s) in code>

    UI: The client shall implement a command line interface (up for debate, just putting it in for now)
        Client: <file(s) or location(s) in code>
