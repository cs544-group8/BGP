BGP Protocol Requirements

Client/Server Requirements:
    Stateful: Both client and server must implement, check and validate the statefulness of the BGP protocol DFA.
        Client: client/tictactoe/src/client.cpp Client::run()
        Server: server/state_machine.py

Server-specific Requirements:

    Concurrent: Server must be able to handle multiple clients.
        Server: server/threadedserver.py spawns a new thread for each connection it receives (in server/threaded_server.py --> ThreadedRequestHandler.handle())

    Service: The server must bind to a hardcoded port number and the client defaults to that port number (port 9999).
        Server: in __main__ of server/threadedserver.py, port is hard coded to 9999

    Game Type Validation: The server must handle incoming NEWGAMETYPE messages and validate the game type contained in the message.
        Server: server/game_type.py (game_id_check())

    Forward MOVE: The server must handle incoming MOVE message and forward them to the associated client.
        Server: server/state_machine.py (we have a StateMachine object per connection, paired state machines get references to each other so they can forward moves to each other's sockets (self.opponent_sm.send()))

    Sender Message Authentication: The server must authenticate the Client ID in messages from a sending client after the "Client ID Assigned" state has been reached.
        Server: server/state_machine.py (valid_message())

    Client ID Generation: The server must generate random 32-bit Client IDs.
        Server: uuid module used (call to uuid.uuid4()) in server/state_machine.py

    Game End Two Way Handshake: The server must be able to handle two way game end handshake.
        Server: server/state_machine.py

    Find Opponent: The server must be able to detect two clients who are both waiting in the "Finding Opponent" state.
        Server: server/state_machine.py makes a call to ThreadedServer.findOpponent()

Client-specific Requirements:

    IP and hostname: Client shall be able to specify the hostname and/or the IP address of the server.
        Client: client/tictactoe/src/client.cpp Client::connected()

    UI: The client shall implement a command line interface
        Client: client/tictactoe/src/client.cpp Client::requestGame()

    Service: The client shall connect to the server on a hardcoded port number, which defaults to port number (port 9999).
       Client: client/tictactoe/src/client.cpp Client::run()

    Game Type Validation: The client shall send a NEWGAMETYPE message for server validation of the game type contained in the message.
       Client: client/tictactoe/src/client.cpp Client::requestGame()

    Client ID: The client shall accept and store a server generated 32 bit Client ID.
       Client: client/tictactoe/src/client.cpp Client::assignID()

    Client ID Authentication: The client shall include the Client ID in all messages sent, after receiving the Client ID.
       Client: client/tictactoe/src/pdu.cpp PDU::buildPDU()

    PDU Validation: The client shall validate the protocol version, message type, and client ID of all messages received.
       Client: client/tictactoe/src/client.cpp Client::receivedHeader()

    Player ID: The client shall accept and store a server generated Player ID. Player #1 shall make the first move.
       Client: client/tictactoe/src/client.cpp Client::assignPlayer()

    Game Move: The client shall send a game move to the server, when it is the clients turn to move.
       Client: client/tictactoe/src/client.cpp Client::outgoingMove()

    Invalid Move: The client shall send an invalid move message to the server, when the move is invalid for the game.
       Client: client/tictactoe/src/client.cpp Client::incomingMove()

    Reset Game: The client shall send an reset message to the server, when the player request to reset the game.
       Client: client/tictactoe/src/client.cpp Client::requestReset()

    Reset Game Acknowledgement: The client shall send an reset ack message to the server, when the player accepts the game reset.
       Client: client/tictactoe/src/client.cpp Client::resetResponse()

    Reset Game Negative Acknowledgement: The client shall send an reset nack message to the server, when the player rejects the game reset.
       Client: client/tictactoe/src/client.cpp Client::resetResponse()

    Game End: The client shall send an game end message to the server, when the player ends the game.
       Client: client/tictactoe/src/client.cpp Client::gameOver()

    Game End Acknowledgement: The client shall send an game end acknowledgement message to the server, when the player accepts the game end.
       Client: client/tictactoe/src/client.cpp Client::gameOver()
